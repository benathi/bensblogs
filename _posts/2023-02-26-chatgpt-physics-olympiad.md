In physics, whenever we have an equality relation, both sides of the
equation should be of the same type i.e. they must have the same
dimensions. For example you cannot have a situation where the quantity
on the right-hand side of the equation represents a length and the
quantity on the left-hand side represents a time interval. Using this
fact, sometimes one can nearly deduce the form of a physical relation
without solving the problem analytically. For example if we were asked
to find the time it takes for an object to fall from a height of $h$
under the influence of a constant gravitational acceleration $g$, we
could argue that one only needs to build a quantity representing a time
interval, using the quantities $g$ and $h$ and the only possible way of
doing this is $T=a(h / g)^{1 / 2}$. Notice that this solution includes
an as yet undetermined coefficient $a$ which is dimensionless and thus
cannot be determined, using this method. This coefficient can be a
number such as $1,1 / 2, \sqrt{3}, \pi$, or any other real number. This
method of deducing physical relations is called *dimensional analysis*.
In dimensional analysis, the dimensionless coefficients are not
important and we do not need to write them. Fortunately, in most
physical problems these coefficients are of the order of 1, and
eliminating them does not change the order of magnitude of the physical
quantities. Therefore, by applying the dimensional analysis to the above
problem, one obtains $T=(h / g)^{1 / 2}$.

Generally, the dimensions of a physical quantity are written in terms of
the dimensions of four fundamental quantities: $M$ (mass), $L$ (length),
$T$ (time), and $K$ (temperature). The dimensions of an arbitrary
quantity, $x$ is denoted by $[x]$. As an example, to express the
dimensions of velocity $v$, kinetic energy $E_k$, and heat capacity
$C_V$ we write:
$[v]=L T^{-1},\left[E_k\right]=M L^2 T^{-2},\left[C_V\right]=M L^2 T^{-2} K^{-1}$.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the black body emissive power which

the black body.

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}**

Using dimensional analysis, we can express the dimensions of the
fundamental constants in terms of the dimensions of length $L$, mass
$M$, time $T$, and temperature $K$ as follows:

Planck's constant, $h$: $[h] = M L^2 T^{-1}$ Speed of light, $c$:
$[c] = L T^{-1}$ Universal constant of gravitation, $G$:
$[G] = L^3 M^{-1} T^{-2}$ Boltzmann constant, $k_B$:
$[k_B] = M L^2 T^{-2} K^{-1}$ It is important to note that the
dimensions of a physical constant are independent of the system of units
used to measure it.

All correct. Note that ChatGPT seems to derive all these answers
internally without providing the reasoning steps. For human, unless we
remember, we would use a relevant equation we know such as $h \nu = E$
for such analysis.

:::
:::

The Stefan-Boltzmann's constant is not a fundamental constant and one
can write it in terms of fundamental constants i.e. one can write
$\sigma=a h^\alpha c^\beta G^\gamma k_B^\delta$. In this relation, $a$
is a dimensionless parameter of the order of 1. As mentioned before, the
exact value of $a$ is not significant from our viewpoint, so we will set
it equal to 1.

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}**

Using the relation
$\sigma = a h^{\alpha} c^{\beta} G^{\gamma} k_B^{\delta}$, we can
determine the dimensions of the Stefan-Boltzmann's constant, $\sigma$,
in terms of the dimensions of length $L$, mass $M$, time $T$, and
temperature $K$ as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
&= [a]\cdot[h^\alpha]\cdot[c^\beta]\cdot[G^\gamma]\cdot[k_B^\delta]\ \\
&= 1 \cdot (M L^2 T^{-1})^\alpha \cdot (L T^{-1})^\beta \cdot (L^3 M^{-1} T^{-2})^\gamma \cdot (M L^2 T^{-2} K^{-1})^\delta\  \\
&= M^\delta L^{2\alpha+\beta+3\gamma} T^{-\alpha-\beta-2\gamma-2\delta} K^{-\delta}
\end{aligned}$$

Since the expression $\sigma\theta^4$ in the Stefan-Boltzmann law must
have units of power per unit area, we know that
$[\sigma\theta^4] = M^0 L^{-2} T^{-3} K^4$. Therefore, we can equate the
dimensions of $\sigma$ and $\theta$ to obtain:

$$\begin{aligned}
&= [\sigma][\theta]^4 = M^\delta L^{2\alpha+\beta+3\gamma} T^{-\alpha-\beta-2\gamma-2\delta} K^{-\delta} K^4 L^{-2} T^{-3} M^0\ \\
&= M^\delta L^{2\alpha+\beta+3\gamma-2} T^{-\alpha-\beta-2\gamma-2\delta-3} K^{4-\delta}
\end{aligned}$$

We want this expression to be equal to $M^0 L^{-2} T^{-3} K^4$.
Therefore, we need to solve the following system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
2\alpha + \beta + 3\gamma &= 2 \ 
-\alpha - \beta - 2\gamma - 2\delta \\ &= -3 \
4-\delta \\ &= 4 
\end{aligned}$$

Solving this system of equations, we obtain $\alpha = 0$, $\beta = -5$,
$\gamma = 1$, and $\delta = 0$. Therefore, the dimensions of the
Stefan-Boltzmann's constant in terms of the dimensions of length $L$,
mass $M$, time $T$, and temperature $K$ are:

$$\begin{aligned}
&= M^0 L^{-2} T^{-3} K^0 = L^{-2} T^{-3}
\end{aligned}$$

**[ChatGPT's Grade: ]{style="color: myred"}** 0.1

The logic is correct up until "we know that
$[\sigma\theta^4] = M^0 L^{-2} T^{-3} K^4$." The correct reasoning
should be that $\sigma \theta^4$ has the same unit as power per area (as
stated in the problem), then the dimension is
$[E] T^{-1} L^{-2} = M T^{-3}$. This is because the model does not
correctly infer from Stefan-Boltzmann law that $\sigma \theta^4$ has the
same unit as power per area, as stated in \"The Stefan-Boltzmann law
states that the black body emissive power which is the total energy
radiated per unit surface area of a black body in unit time is equal to
$\sigma \theta^4$\" (-0.3)

The logic for setting up the equation \"Therefore, we can equate the
dimensions of $\sigma$ and $\theta$ to obtain\" and what comes after is
also incorrect. (-0.1)

The final answer is incorrect.

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** To find the values of
$\alpha, \beta, \gamma,$ and $\delta$ using dimensional analysis, we can
express the quantity to be determined as a product of powers of the
fundamental quantities. Let's consider an arbitrary physical quantity
$Q$ that depends on mass $M$, length $L$, time $T$, and temperature $K$.
We can express $Q$ in terms of its dimensions as follows:

$$= M^\alpha L^\beta T^\gamma K^\delta$$

where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma,$ and $\delta$ are unknown exponents to be
determined. Let's assume that $Q$ depends on $n$ fundamental quantities,
which means that $n$ of these exponents are non-zero.

Now, let's consider $m$ fundamental quantities $Q$ depends on, where
$m < n$. We can choose $m$ quantities to be the independent variables in
$Q$, and we can express the remaining $n-m$ variables in terms of these
$m$ variables using the relationships between them. We can then
substitute these expressions into the original expression for $Q$ to
obtain an expression for $Q$ solely in terms of $m$ independent
variables. We can then equate the dimensions of both sides of the
resulting equation to determine the unknown exponents.

As an example, let's determine the values of $\alpha, \beta, \gamma,$
and $\delta$ for the period $T$ of a simple pendulum of length $l$ and
mass $m$. The period $T$ of a pendulum is given by:

$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. We can express the
dimensions of $T$, $l$, $m$, and $g$ as:

$$= T, \quad [l] = L, \quad [m] = M, \quad [g] = L T^{-2}$$

We can choose $m = 2$ and the independent variables to be $l$ and $g$.
The period $T$ can then be expressed as:

$$T = \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\cdot 2\pi$$

We can now equate the dimensions of both sides of this equation to
determine the unknown exponents:

$$\begin{aligned}
&= [l]^{a}[g]^{b} \notag\
T &= L^{a} (L T^{-2})^{b} = L^{a-b} T^{-2b}
\end{aligned}$$

Equating the dimensions of both sides, we obtain the following system of
equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
a - b &= 0 \
-2b &= 1
\end{aligned}$$

Solving this system of equations, we obtain $a = b = 0$ and $b = -1/2$.
Therefore, the dimensions of the period $T$ of a simple pendulum in
terms of the dimensions of length $L$, mass $M$, time $T$, and
temperature $K$ are:

$$= L^{0} M^{0} T^{1} K^{0} = T$$

This result agrees with our previous knowledge that the period of a
pendulum is a quantity with dimensions of time.

Incorrect. The model did not answer the question that is related to the
main problem statement. It is possible that the context is insufficient.

# Physics of Black Holes

In this part of the problem, we would like to find out some properties
of black holes using dimensional analysis. According to a certain
theorem in physics known as the *no hair theorem*, all the
characteristics of the black hole which we are considering in this
problem depend only on the mass of the black hole. One characteristic of
a black hole is the area of its event horizon. Roughly speaking, the
*event horizon* is the boundary of the black hole. Inside this boundary,
the gravity is so strong that even light cannot emerge from the region
enclosed by the boundary.

We would like to find a relation between the mass of a black hole, $m$,
and the area of its event horizon, $A$. This area depends on the mass of
the black hole, the speed of light, and the universal constant of
gravitation. As in $1.3$ we shall write $A=G^\alpha c^\beta m^\gamma$.

::: adjustbox

::: tabular
\| C5mm \| L0.9 \| C5mm \| & Use dimensional analysis to find
$\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$. & 0.8\
:::
:::

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** To find the dimensions
of $A$, we can recall that the units of area are given by $L^2$, where
$L$ represents a length. The units of $G$ are $L^3/(M T^2)$, where $M$
represents mass and $T$ represents time, and the units of $c$ are $L/T$.
Therefore, we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
A &= G^\alpha c^\beta m^\gamma \\
[L^2] &= \left[\frac{L^3}{MT^2}\right]^\alpha \cdot \left[\frac{L}{T}\right]^\beta \cdot [M]^\gamma \\
[L^2] &= L^{3\alpha+\beta} \cdot T^{-2\alpha-\beta} \cdot M^\gamma \\
\end{aligned}$$

This gives us three equations relating the exponents of $L$, $T$, and
$M$:

$$\begin{aligned}
3\alpha + \beta &= 2 \\
-2\alpha - \beta &= 0 \\
\gamma &= 0
\end{aligned}$$

Solving for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}
\alpha &= -\frac{1}{2} \\
\beta &= 3\alpha = -\frac{3}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the relation between the mass of a black hole, $m$, and the
area of its event horizon, $A$, is:

$$A = k\frac{G^{-1/2}c^{3/2}}{\sqrt{m}},$$

where $k$ is a dimensionless constant.

**[ChatGPT's Grade: ]{style="color: myred"}** 0.3

The step
$[L^2] = L^{3\alpha+\beta} \cdot T^{-2\alpha-\beta} \cdot M^\gamma$ is
slightly incorrect. The M term should be $[M]^{\gamma - \alpha}$ (-0.1)

The model also did not solve the equations correctly. (-0.4)

From the result of $2.1$ it becomes clear that the area of the event
horizon of a black hole increases with its mass. From a classical point
of view, nothing comes out of a black hole and therefore in all physical
processes the area of the event horizon can only increase. In analogy
with the second law of thermodynamics, Bekenstein proposed to assign
entropy, $S$, to a black hole, proportional to the area of its event
horizon i.e. $S=\eta A$. This conjecture has been made more plausible
using other arguments.

# Hawking Radiation

With a semi-quantum mechanical approach, Hawking argued that contrary to
the classical point of view, black holes emit radiation similar to the
radiation of a black body at a temperature which is called the *Hawking
temperature*.

no work on its surroundings. & 0.8\
:::
:::

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** To derive the Hawking
temperature of a black hole, we can use the laws of thermodynamics,
specifically the first and second laws. The first law of thermodynamics
relates the change in energy of a system to the heat added to it and the
work done on it:

$$dE = T dS - P dV$$

where $E$ is the internal energy of the system, $S$ is its entropy, $T$
is its temperature, $P$ is its pressure, $V$ is its volume, and $d$
denotes a differential change in the corresponding variable.

For a non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole, its entropy is
given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:

$$S_{BH} = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 G \hbar}$$

where $A$ is the area of the black hole's event horizon,
$\hbar=h/(2\pi)$ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $k_B$ is the
Boltzmann constant.

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed
system cannot decrease, i.e., $dS \geq 0$. Since a black hole can only
gain mass, its area and entropy can only increase, which means that
$dS_{BH} \geq 0$. Thus, we can rewrite the first law of thermodynamics
as:

$$dE = T_{H} dS_{BH}$$

where $T_{H}$ is the temperature of the black hole, which we call the
Hawking temperature.

Using the formula for the entropy of a black hole, we can express the
temperature of a black hole in terms of its mass $M$:

$$T_{H} = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi k_B G M}$$

Therefore, the Hawking temperature of a black hole can be expressed in
terms of its mass and the fundamental constants as:

$$\boxed{\theta_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi k_B G M}}$$

This formula shows that the Hawking temperature of a black hole is
inversely proportional to its mass. As the black hole loses mass due to
Hawking radiation, its temperature increases, and it eventually
evaporates completely when its mass reaches a very small value.

**[ChatGPT's Grade: ]{style="color: myred"}** 0.4

Correct. The reasoning steps and derivations are missing in a few
places. (1) The effect of the blackhole doing no work on the system is
not clearly incorporated in the analysis (2) not clear how the model
derives T from the equation of $S$ and $E = mc^2$. More reasoning steps
are required for full score.

black hole and the fundamental constants. & 0.7\
:::
:::

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** The rate of change of
the mass of a black hole due to Hawking radiation can be obtained from
the energy conservation law. The energy lost by the black hole due to
radiation is given by:

$$dE = -\frac{\hbar c^6}{15360\pi G^2 M^2} dt$$

where $M$ is the mass of the black hole and $t$ is time. This expression
for $dE$ can be obtained by integrating the energy flux of the outgoing
radiation over the surface area of the black hole's event horizon.

By using the relation $E = mc^2$, we can convert the change in energy to
the change in mass:

$$dM = -\frac{dE}{c^2} = -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360\pi G^2 M^2} dt$$

The rate of change of mass $dM/dt$ can be found by taking the time
derivative of the above equation:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360\pi G^2 M^2}$$

We can express the Hawking temperature in terms of the mass of the black
hole, using the same formula we derived in problem 3.1:

$$\theta_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi k_B G M}$$

Substituting this expression into the equation for the rate of change of
mass, we get:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{k_B^4 \theta_H^4}{15360 \pi^2 \hbar^3 c^2}$$

Therefore, the rate of change of the mass of a black hole due to Hawking
radiation is given by:

$$\boxed{\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{k_B^4}{15360 \pi^2 \hbar^3 c^2} \left(\frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi k_B G M}\right)^4}$$

This formula shows that the rate of change of the mass of a black hole
due to Hawking radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the
Hawking temperature. It also shows that the rate of change of mass is
inversely proportional to the square of the mass of the black hole. As
the black hole loses mass due to Hawking radiation, its rate of mass
loss increases, and it eventually evaporates completely when its mass
reaches a very small value.

incorrect

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** Sure, here's a possible
analysis of the solution for problem 3.2:

The solution correctly uses the energy conservation law to derive the
rate of change of the mass of a black hole due to Hawking radiation. The
solution then expresses this rate in terms of the Hawking temperature,
which is found in problem 3.1. The final formula for the rate of change
of mass due to Hawking radiation is consistent with previous results in
the literature.

However, the solution could benefit from clearer and more detailed
explanations of the key steps. Here is a possible revised solution with
more detailed reasoning steps:

To find the rate of change of the mass of a black hole due to Hawking
radiation, we use the energy conservation law, which relates the change
in energy of a system to the energy that flows in or out of the system:

$$dE = -dE_{rad}$$

where $dE$ is the change in the energy of the black hole and $dE_{rad}$
is the energy carried away by the radiation. We can express $dE_{rad}$
in terms of the temperature and entropy of the black hole using the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the energy radiated by a black body
to its temperature:

$$dE_{rad} = \sigma A T^4 dt$$

where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the area of the
black hole's event horizon, and $T$ is the Hawking temperature of the
black hole, which is given by:

$$T = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi k_B G M}$$

Substituting this expression into the equation for $dE_{rad}$ and
integrating over time, we obtain the total energy radiated by the black
hole:

$$E_{rad} = \frac{\hbar c^4}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2}$$

Using the relation $E=mc^2$, we can convert this energy to a change in
mass:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{dE_{rad}}{c^2} = -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2 c^2}$$

Simplifying this expression and substituting in the expression for the
Hawking temperature, we obtain the final formula for the rate of change
of mass due to Hawking radiation:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{k_B^4}{15360 \pi^2 \hbar^3 c^2} \left(\frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi k_B G M}\right)^4$$

This formula shows that the rate of change of the mass of a black hole
due to Hawking radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the
Hawking temperature, and inversely proportional to the square of the
mass of the black hole. This means that smaller black holes lose mass
more quickly than larger black holes. The formula also shows that the
rate of mass loss due to Hawking radiation is extremely slow for
astronomical black holes, which have masses on the order of millions or
billions of times the mass of the sun.

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** I apologize for the
confusion. After reviewing my previous response, I realize that it is
incorrect. Here's a corrected solution:

To find the rate of change of the mass of a black hole due to Hawking
radiation, we can start by considering the energy flux of the outgoing
radiation at the black hole's event horizon. This flux can be expressed
as:

$$F = \frac{\sigma}{c} T_H^4$$

where $T_H$ is the Hawking temperature of the black hole, which we found
in problem 3.1, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The total power radiated by the black hole is given by integrating the
energy flux over the area of the black hole's event horizon:

$$P = \int F dA = \frac{4 \pi G^2 M^2}{c^4} \frac{\sigma}{c} T_H^4 = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2}$$

where we have used the relation $T_H = \hbar c^3/(8 \pi G k_B M)$ from
problem 3.1.

Using the relation $E = mc^2$, we can convert the power to a rate of
change of mass:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{P}{c^2} = -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2 c^2}$$

Therefore, the rate of change of the mass of a black hole due to Hawking
radiation is given by:

$$\boxed{\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2 c^2}}$$

This formula shows that the rate of mass loss due to Hawking radiation
is extremely slow for astronomical black holes, which have masses on the
order of millions or billions of times the mass of the sun. The rate of
mass loss increases as the mass of the black hole decreases, and the
black hole eventually evaporates completely when its mass reaches a very
small value.

:::
:::

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** The rate of change of
the mass of a black hole due to Hawking radiation, as derived in problem
3.2, is given by:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2 c^2}$$

We can integrate this equation to find the time $t^*$ it takes for a
black hole to evaporate completely, starting from an initial mass
$M_0 = m$:

$$\int_{m}^{0} \frac{dM}{dt} dt = \int_{0}^{t^*} -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2 c^2} dt$$

Solving this integral, we get:

$$t^* = \frac{5120 \pi G^2 M_0^3}{\hbar c^4}$$

Substituting in the expressions for the fundamental constants, we
obtain:

$$t^* = \frac{5120 \pi G^3 m^3}{\hbar c^4}$$

Therefore, the time it takes for a black hole of mass $m$ to evaporate
completely due to Hawking radiation is:

$$\boxed{t^* = \frac{5120 \pi G^3 m^3}{\hbar c^4}}$$

This formula shows that the evaporation time of a black hole is
proportional to the cube of its mass, and inversely proportional to the
fourth power of the fundamental constants. For a black hole with the
mass of the sun, this time is on the order of $10^{67}$ years, which is
much longer than the current age of the universe. For smaller black
holes, the evaporation time is much shorter, and can be on the order of
seconds or even microseconds for black holes with masses close to the
Planck mass.

**[ChatGPT's Answer: ]{style="color: myblue"}** The heat capacity of a
system is defined as the rate of change of its internal energy with
respect to its temperature:

$$C = \frac{dE}{dT}$$

For a black hole, the internal energy is given by its mass-energy
$E=mc^2$, and the temperature is given by the Hawking temperature $T_H$
derived in problem 3.1.

Differentiating the expression for the internal energy with respect to
temperature, we get:

$$\frac{dE}{dT} = \frac{d}{dT} (mc^2) = 0$$

since the mass of the black hole is constant.

Using the expression for the Hawking temperature derived in problem 3.1,
we can express the heat capacity of a black hole in terms of its mass
$m$ and the fundamental constants:

$$C = \frac{dE}{dT} = \frac{d}{dT}(mc^2) = \frac{dE}{dT_H}\frac{dT_H}{dT} = \frac{-2 k_B^2 \pi G m^2 c^4}{\hbar^2 T_H^3}$$

Substituting in the expression for the Hawking temperature, we obtain:

$$C = \boxed{-\frac{2 k_B^2 \pi G m^2 c^4}{\hbar^2} \left(\frac{8 \pi G k_B m}{\hbar c^3}\right)^3}$$

This formula shows that the heat capacity of a black hole is negative.
This means that the black hole is a thermodynamically unstable system,
since it would radiate away more energy as its temperature increased,
leading to a decrease in its mass and a further increase in its
temperature. The heat capacity is also proportional to the square of the
mass of the black hole, and inversely proportional to the sixth power of
the fundamental constants. For astronomical black holes, the heat
capacity is extremely small, and it approaches zero as the mass of the
black hole increases.

The first equation is set up correctly. however the rest are incorrect.

# Black Holes and the Cosmic Background Radiation

Consider a black hole exposed to the cosmic background radiation. The
cosmic background radiation is a black body radiation with a temperature
$\theta_B$ which fills the entire universe. An object with a total area
$A$ will thus receive an energy equal to $\sigma \theta_B^4 \times A$
per unit time. A black hole, therefore, loses energy through Hawking
radiation and gains energy from the cosmic background radiation.
